Now, I want to modify my backend even more. 

I want to create authentication with jwt. There will be two roles: admin and user. 
If a user logs into the dashboard, they will see only the events they have created, then they can perform CRUD operations on them. But when an admin logs in, they will be able to see all the events, and perform CRUD operations on it.
This means that when a user wants to login, there will be a need to determine whether it is a user or an admin. It also means anybody that is not logged in will not be able to create events. 
Note that all events will still show on the dashboard. 

Also, this will modify our events schema. Now we will need to add the name of the creator of the event to the data a single event is returning
